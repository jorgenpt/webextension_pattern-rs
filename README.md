# webextension\_pattern

webextension\_pattern implements support for matching URLs with a
powerful and intuitive pattern. It's simpler than regular expressions,
and specifically tailored to URL matching.  It's the format used by
Mozilla's WebExtensions for matching URLs, as well as Google Chrome, and
you can find their documentation here:

 - [Reference on
 developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Match_patterns)
 - [Reference on
 developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/match_patterns/)

This crate aims to be compatible with Mozilla's implementation,
specifically, but also supports a "relaxed" mode that does not strictly
adhere, for user-friendliness.
